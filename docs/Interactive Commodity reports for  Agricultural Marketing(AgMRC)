## I2D2 Dashboard 2021
The goal of the I2D2 Dashboard project was to build tools for data collection to produce indicators of childhood wellness as identified by [Early Childhood Iowa](https://earlychildhood.iowa.gov/document/indicators-and-data-dictionary) and structure this data within an accessible [**dashboard**](https://i2d2.shinyapps.io/DSPG_2021_Dashboard/).

This dashboard should serve a wide array of purposes, including providing data for early childhood agencies writing grant applications, aiding advocacy work, and informing policy-makers and legislators about the state of early childhood wellness.
